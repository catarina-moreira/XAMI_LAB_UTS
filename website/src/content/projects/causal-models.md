Deep learning models have achieved high performance across different domains, such as
medical decision-making, autonomous vehicles, and decision support systems, among many
others. However, despite this success, the inner mechanisms of these models are opaque
because their internal representations are too complex for a human to understand. This
opacity makes it hard to understand the how or the why of the predictions of deep
learning models.

Recently, there has been a growing interest in the literature in "what-if" explanations,
which are called counterfactuals. An example of such explanations is the following: "My
loan application got rejected. What would I have to change in my application to make my
loan accepted?". Counterfactuals in XAI are currently the bridge between traditional
machine-based statistical analysis, human risk factor models, and explainable artificial
intelligence.

This research theme aims to make machine learning models understandable to human decision
makers by providing human-centric counterfactual explanations of their inner workings. It
builds on the hypothesis that causality is a crucial missing ingredient for opening the
black box to render it understandable to human decision makers through counterfactual
"what-if" explanations. Current explainable algorithms in the literature are based on
correlations and sensitive to sampling bias, which can make the explanations more biased
than the black box itself. In this research theme, we argue that to achieve
explainability, causality is a necessary condition to achieve human-understandable
explanations. The topics covered in this research theme include:

- Build counterfactual algorithms in XAI
- Develop causal inference methods for XAI from observational data
- Novel probabilistic interpretable algorithms for XAI
- Develop standardized evaluation protocols for counterfactuals in XAI
